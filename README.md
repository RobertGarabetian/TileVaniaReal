TileVaniaReal is a 2D platformer game that I created in Unity using C#!
For the purpose of simplicity I only uploaded the files that I modified and programmed for the game uploaded to Github.
Creating this game is how I learned to code and it took me many hours to complete!

There are 9 different levels and choosing to start the game on easy difficulty will start you at level 1, 
choosing medium difficulty will start you at level 3, and hard difficulty will start you at level 6.

Here is the link to play the game! It is far from perfect but it was a lot of fun to build and a great first programming experiance!
